Amazon has a pretty nice write-up about how to create an HA NAT setup in multiple subnets/AZs.  They also offer a CloudFormation template that works pretty well.  However, the monitor script code that is downloaded  with the template is out of date.  Since they control both resources, I had little choice but to virtually-clone them into this repo to fix them for future reference in other projects.
